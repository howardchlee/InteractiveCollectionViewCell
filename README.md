# InteractiveCollectionViewCell

The InteractiveCollectionViewCell will display an overlay from the point at which it is tapped on when it's selected.  The overlay expands as a circle until the until cell is covered.  The image within the cell will also be scaled when it's selected.  When the cell is unselected, the animation will be reversed.  This can happen even if the selected animation has not completed when the cell is unselected.

This project is created with Xcode 7 on iOS 9 with Swift 2.2.  It will be updated to Swift 3 when Xcode 8 is officially released.
